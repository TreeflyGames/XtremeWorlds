Creation Features:
==================
The client has editors for the world (maps), items, spells, animations, npcs, and more from the in game admin panel.

How do I use this software?
===========================
If you are a programmer then you will probably prefer to compile the most recent version from source. Download the engine here, open up the solution in Visual Studio compile both projects and start the client and server application. They should connect automatically. IP and Port options are stored in the root/data (files)/config.ini files.

How do I access the editors?
============================
Log into the game with the client. On the server, open the player list, right click on your character and promote yourself to an admin. Go back to the client and tap Insert for each of the editor options.
